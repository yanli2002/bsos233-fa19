    "#### **Question 1.** Job Opportunities & Education in Rural India\n",

    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A [study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16021.pdf) at UCLA investigated factors that might result in greater attention to the health and education of girls in rural India. One such factor is information about job opportunities for women. The idea is that if people know that educated women can get good jobs, they might take more care of the health and education of girls in their families, as an investment in the girls’ future potential as earners. Without the knowledge of job opportunities, the author hypothesizes that families invest less in their women, and instead, invest in their men.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The study focused on 160 villages outside the capital of India, all with little access to information about call centers and similar organizations that offer job opportunities to women. In 80 of the villages chosen at random, recruiters visited the village, described the opportunities, recruited women who had some English language proficiency and experience with computers, and provided ongoing support free of charge for three years. In the other 80 villages, no recruiters visited and no other intervention was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At the end of the study period, the researchers recorded data about the school attendance and health of the children in the villages."

    "**c)** The study reported, “Girls aged 5-15 in villages that received the recruiting services were 3 to 5 percentage points more likely to be in school and experienced an increase in Body Mass Index, reflecting greater nutrition and/or medical care. However, there was no net gain in height. For boys, there was no change in any of these measures.” Why do you think the author points out the lack of change in the boys?"
