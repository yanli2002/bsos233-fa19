    "### Question 1. Job Opportunities & Education in Rural India\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A [study](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16021.pdf) at UCLA investigated factors that might result in greater attention to the health and education of girls in rural India. One such factor is information about job opportunities for women. The idea is that if people know that educated women can get good jobs, they might take more care of the health and education of girls in their families, as an investment in the girls’ future potential as earners. Without the knowledge of job opportunities, the author hypothesizes that families invest less in their women, and instead, invest in their men.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> The study focused on 160 villages outside the capital of India, all with little access to information about call centers and similar organizations that offer job opportunities to women. In 80 of the villages chosen at random, recruiters visited the village, described the opportunities, recruited women who had some English language proficiency and experience with computers, and provided ongoing support free of charge for three years. In the other 80 villages, no recruiters visited and no other intervention was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "> At the end of the study period, the researchers recorded data about the school attendance and health of the children in the villages."

    "\n",

Of the children who slept with a night light on before the age of 2, 34% were myopic. Of the children who slept in the dark before the age of 2, 10% were myopic. The study concluded that, \"The prevalence of myopia [...] during childhood was strongly associated with ambient light exposure during sleep at night in the first two years after birth.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "In 2017, Cards Against Humanity partnered with Survey Sampling International to conduct a poll of the American public. A series of these were run monthly, with a different sample and questions changing over each month. Each survey included basic demographic information, such as Gender and Age, as well as a series of questions about opinion, lifestyle, or knowledge . As might be expected from a poll run by Cards Against Humanity, the questions varied from serious to silly and seemingly irrelevant. \n",
